# Hamilton Project
#### A data analysis and visualization project providing insight into legislative branch spending.

The primary goals of this project are to:
1. Clean up publicly available disbursement data to make it easier for reporters, elected officials, constituents, anyone to understand how money is being spent.
  * Match and consolidate like vendors
  * Catch and fix misspellings

2. Visualize data to provide insight into the breakdown of expenditures. Some simple calculations could include:
  * Spending by Member
  * Amount received by Vendor
  * Compensation by Staff Title
---
#### Deliverables
  * A well-documented methodology for cleaning data
  * A stable and reliable single .csv for further exploration
  * A flexible data visualization tool
  * A detailed explanation for all expenses by office and category

NOTE: This is an educational experiment designed to provide some beneficial insight.
